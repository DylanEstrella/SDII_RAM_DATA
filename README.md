<h1>Digital System Project:</h1>
<h3>Design of a MSS with VHDL to compare data in some RAMS units.</h3>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
This project was developed for an FPGA in VHDL using the concept of synchronous machines.
For this project, we designed two SRAMs with default data and then read their contents to 
compare their values and if both are the same, the system will display the content on three LCDs.
</p>

<h2>Blocks developed</h2>

<p>
Some blocks with specific behavior were designed for this project, 
they are all located in the "Blocks" folder. There we can find the SRAM memories, multiplexers, counters, demultiplexers, etc.

<h2>Simulation</h2>
<h4>We use Model-Sim-Altera in Quartus II software</h4>
